The following info found for the robot

LINE SENSOR
The five line sensors face downward and can
help the Zumo distinguish between light and
dark surfaces.


PROXIMITY SENSORS
The proximity sensors, like the line sensors, detect reflected IR light, 
but they are designed to only detect light that is turned on and off quickly at a frequency of 38 kHz

The proximity sensors are named after the directions they face: left, right, or front. 
In schematics and diagrams, they are referred to as LEFT, RIGHT, and FRONT.

On the front sensor array, their signals are labeled LFT, FRONT, and RGT
